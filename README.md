- Functions 
- Separation of Concerns 
- DRY Code

run_factory()
```
### TDD - Test Driven Development 

1. Write the test 
2. Run it and read the error 
3. Code and Make it pass

this helps with:
- stops over engineering 
- Maintanable/ Readable Code
- Reduce Technical Debt 
- Goes well with Agile and working code
- Errors can be your guide in complex systems 

How it works is that we write unit Tests.

##### Unit Tests 

**base of a test**
usually has 3 phase.
1. Setup 
2. Calling of Function 
3. Asserting for the expected output
Test single pieces of code. Like a function.
